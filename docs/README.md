# Introduction

Welcome to the Biyard Rust Development Guide. This documentation serves as a comprehensive resource for developers to effectively build, structure, and maintain Rust-based applications within the Biyard ecosystem.

The guide covers project structure, coding standards, development patterns, and practical implementations of web applications, backend services, and blockchain integration using Rust.

## Purpose

The main objective of this documentation is to:

- Standardize Rust project setups and structures for consistency across various Biyard projects.
- Provide clear guidelines and best practices for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust Rust applications.
- Facilitate seamless integration between frontend applications, backend services, and blockchain components (ICP).

## Audience

This guide is intended for:

- **New developers** onboarding into Rust projects at Biyard.
- **Existing developers** looking for best practices, standard patterns, and implementation references.
- **Technical leads and architects** defining guidelines and ensuring consistency across Rust projects.

## Document Overview

This guide is structured into several key sections:

- **Introduction**: Overview of the project and general guidelines for Rust development.
- **Common Package**: Standard components shared across projects, including model definitions, DTOs, validation, and repositories.
- **Frontend**: Detailed instructions and structures for developing web and mobile frontend applications.
- **Backend**: Guidelines for developing backend services, including API design, implementation, and testing.
- **ICP**: Instructions for developing and deploying smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer blockchain.
- **CI/CD**: Best practices and configurations for continuous integration and deployment, including automated testing strategies.
